## App Framework Change History



### Router

* Fixed issue where Router's `hasRoute(url)` method did not follow the same
  semantics as the route dispatching process. Now all registered param handlers
  will process any named params, giving them a chance to validate and reject a
  param value. This will make the `hasRoute()` method an effective way to check
  whether a router will dispatch to a route handler for a given URL. ([#][])
