Why YUI on the server?


	* YUI on server is a possibility
	* 
		* performance concern
		* use-case: render pages fully on server first
		* widget progressive enhancement

	* big use-case: interactive Web apps
	* 
		* progressive enhancement
		* poor network connection
		* no JS on client SEO
		* server models
		* form validation for immediate validation client-side
		* intelligent asset mgt
		* 
			* device detection for module loading (minimal set)
			* cacheability on edge

		* cross-property code reuse; module reuse
		* 
			* one copy of mail inbox

		* code portability
		* 
			* client/server runtime switch: not enough of a reason
