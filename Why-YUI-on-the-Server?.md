Why YUI on the server?


   * YUI on server is a possibility
      * performance concern
      * use-case: render pages fully on server first
      * widget progressive enhancement

   * Big use-case: interactive Web apps
      * progressive enhancement
      * poor network connection
      * no JS on client SEO
      * server models
      * form validation for immediate validation client-side
      * intelligent asset mgt
         * device detection for module loading (minimal set)
         * cacheability on edge
      * cross-property code reuse; module reuse
         * one copy of mail inbox
         * code portability
         * client/server runtime switch: not enough of a reason
