# Panel Accessibility Improvements

## Leverage ARIA
Panel is most likely going to be used to created dialogs, and there are ARIA attributes that will make these dialogs more accessible to users of screen readers. Those are:

* [dialog](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/complete#dialog)
* [alertdialog](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/complete#alertdialog)
* [aria-hiden](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/complete#aria-hidden)
* [aria-labelledby](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/complete#aria-labelledby)
* [aria-describedby](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/complete#aria-describedby)
