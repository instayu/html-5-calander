Welcome to the YUI development wiki!

YUI's official [user guides](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/guides/) and [API docs](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/) are hosted on [yuilibrary.com](http://yuilibrary.com/), but this wiki is where we maintain living documents that are relevant to people who are interested in contributing code or feedback to YUI.

## Current Release: 3.8.0

This release we added two new components: [`Y.Color`](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/color/) and [`Y.Template`](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/template/). We also started refactoring Attribute and Base, this work will be on-going as we squeeze more performance out of these low-level components.
