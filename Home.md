Welcome to the YUI development wiki!

YUI's official [user guides](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/guides/) and [API docs](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/) are hosted on [yuilibrary.com](http://yuilibrary.com/), but this wiki is where we maintain living documents that are relevant to people who are interested in contributing code or feedback to YUI.

## Next Release

The focus for the next release is on adding **IE 10** to [YUI's target environments](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/environments/). YUI's unit tests already fare really well in IE 10's standard desktop mode, but in Windows 8 there are [[multiple runtime environments|Windows 8 JavaScript Runtimes]] (generally more restrictive) in which we want to make sure YUI is supported. 

* Scheduled stable release date: **[[October 16, 2012|Development Schedule]].**
* [[Windows 8 JavaScript Runtimes]] 
* [Open Tickets for Sprint](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/report/138)
