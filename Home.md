Welcome to the YUI development wiki!

YUI's official [user guides](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/guides/) and [API docs](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/) are hosted on [yuilibrary.com](http://yuilibrary.com/), but this wiki is where we maintain living documents that are relevant to people who are interested in contributing code or feedback to YUI.
