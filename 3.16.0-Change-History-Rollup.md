## App Framework Change History



### Router

* Fixed issue where Router's `hasRoute(url)` method did not follow the same
  semantics as the route dispatching process. Now all registered param handlers
  will process any named params, giving them a chance to validate and reject a
  param value. This will make the `hasRoute()` method an effective way to check
  whether a router will dispatch to a route handler for a given URL. ([#][])

## CSS Grids Change History




* Import Grids from Pure 0.4.2. You can now use non-reduced fraction class names when laying out a grid. This means that we have rules for classes such as `.pure-u-12-24` as well as `.pure-u-1-2`.

## YUI Loader Change History




* Optimization of the Loader's constructor by removing _populateCache() in  in favor of an on-demand process to create internal module info based on the raw meta when the module is needed and called thru `getModuleInfo()`. ([#1581][]: @caridy)

[#1581]: https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1581

## Node Change History




* getCell() throws an error if `shift` is not a recognized value.

  from other sandboxes.
