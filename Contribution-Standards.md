## Propose a Submission

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the YUI project! Before we get started, please be sure to [sign a CLA](http://yuilibrary.com/contribute/cla/).

Proposals can be submitted via a pull request or as an idea to the Contributor Mailing List. Submissions that follow our contribution standards and are aligned with the direction of the project will be accepted. Submissions that are not accepted can always be published to YUI Gallery.

Please review YUI’s [Contributor Model](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Contributor-Model/) for more information about how proposals get processed once submitted.

## Development Workflow

Please review YUI’s [Developer Workflow](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Developer-Workflow/) for details on how to set up your Git branches and contribute changes to the YUI project.

## Minimum Requirements

The goal of these requirements is to ensure quality, API consistency, code reusability, and maintainability of the contribution. All contributions must satisfy:

   * Complete API Docs and inline code comments
   * Unit tests with 80% line coverage
   * User Guide (Components only)
   * Functional examples, written up in Selleck format and with test automation (https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Selleck-Example-Tests)
   * Proper commit logs
   * Proper updates to HISTORY.md

The YUI team has created a number of Node.js-based NPM modules to make meeting the above requirements much easier:

   * [shifter](http://yui.github.com/shifter): to build the modules properly and consistently.
   * [yuidocjs](http://yui.github.com/yuidoc/): for live-previewing the API docs.
   * [selleck](http://yui.github.com/selleck/): for live-previewing the user guide and functional examples.
   * [yogi](http://yui.github.com/yogi): helper tool wrapping up the functionality from the above tools.

## Further Recommendations

We recommend the following process for contributing great code to YUI:

### Get feedback early and often 

* An **API review** validates your initial approach
* A **design review** validates your high-level architecture
* A **code review** validates your implementation details
* A **Preview Release** gets you community feedback of working code in real-world situations

### Documentation is just as important as code

* API docs
* Examples
* User guides

### Automate your tests

* Unit
* Functional
* Performance

## A Note About Lint

Please read: https://github.com/yui/yui-lint/blob/master/README.md

We reserve the right to one day fail builds on lint errors.

## Right to Revert

Once the contribution has been merged into the repo, if any issues arise in the integration environment or upon subsequent feedback, the contribution may be reverted.
