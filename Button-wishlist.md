Button is currently tagged as a Beta component, and in order to remove that label, it needs to have a stable architecture and API.  This page will track some of the remaining items that need to be done to consider moving Button out of Beta.

* Default `<button>`'s BOUNDING_TEMPLATE to `type="button"`
* Make ButtonGroup widget single-box
* Make cssbutton more skinnable (involves breaking up the CSS into multiple files)
