*Button is currently tagged as a Beta component, and in order to remove that label, it needs to have a stable architecture and API.  This living document will track some of the remaining items that need to be done to consider moving Button out of Beta.*

To-do:
* Default Y.Button's BOUNDING_TEMPLATE to `<button type="button">` ([src](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/968#issuecomment-22223123))
* Make ButtonGroup widget single-box ([src](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1125#issuecomment-24051371))
* Make cssbutton more skinnable (involves breaking up the CSS into multiple files)
* Introduce toggle plugin ([src](https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/master/src/button/js/button.js#L183))
* Improve documentation & examples.  Finish [keyboard demo](https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/master/src/button/tests/manual/keyboard.html)
* Add performance tests
* Increase Button's unit test count to strengthen coverage.  For instance, it could use more tests for `<input type="button">` elements (assuming that continues to be a supported element).

Done: 
* [Preserve Y.Button node attributes on render()](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1125)
* [Added HTML support for Button labels](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1163)
