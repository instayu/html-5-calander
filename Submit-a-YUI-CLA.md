## YUI's Contributor License Agreement
If you want to make contributions (software, documentation or other material) to the YUI Project and such contributions could be covered under intellectual property laws, you must submit a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) prior to making your contribution:

1. Review [YUI's BSD license](http://yuilibrary.com/license/). All YUI components are issued under this license, and contributions you make to the library will be subject to this license. Note that the BSD license is very liberal; it allows for reuse and adaptation in commercial projects.
2. [Submit the YUI CLA online](https://yahoocla.herokuapp.com/). You will need to sign in via GitHub.com to electronicially sign the CLA.
If you have questions about the CLA, you can address them to yui-cla (at) yahoo-inc.com.

## What Is the Purpose of the CLA?
The CLA ensures that everyone who submits a work of authorship to the YUI Library is contributing work that is their own or for which they can authoritatively speak. This protects the tens of thousands of developers who use YUI in their daily work, all of whom rely on YUI's BSD license to appropriately cover their use of the library.

The CLA does not transfer title or copyright of your contributed work to Yahoo!. It merely guarantees that you approve the use of your work within YUI and by those who use the library under the terms of its license.

## What Contributions Require a CLA?
Broadly speaking, anything that could constitute a work of authorship requires a signed CLA for contribution to YUI. Here are some examples:

* Code
* Documentation
* Examples or demo code that becomes part of the YUI distribution or YUI web site
* Graphics or other visual creative work that becomes part of the YUI distribution or YUI web site

You do not need to submit a CLA to create bug reports or feature requests for YUI components. You do not need to submit a CLA to create Gallery modules, but a CLA _is_ required to host Gallery modules on the Yahoo! CDN.
