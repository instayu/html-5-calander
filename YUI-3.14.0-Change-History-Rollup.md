## YUI Core Change History


* Added support to the YUI module system to work with modules written as
  ECMAScript Modules which are transpiled to YUI modules. ([#1407][])

  Modules are being added to ES6, but need to be transpiled into code that can
  run in today's JavaScript environments. This changes makes it possible for YUI
  modules to work as ES6 Module transpile target.

  An `es` flag on a YUI module's `details` signals to the YUI module system and
  Loader that the module was transpiled from a ES6 module; this allows YUI to
  conform to the module body's expectations around imports and exports.

  When the `es` flag is set to a truthy value, the module body function will
  receive two additional arguments: `imports` and `exports`, giving it the
  signature: `function (Y, NAME, __imports__, __exports__) {...}`. Also, the
  module body's `return` value becomes significant and is used and stored as the
  module's `exports`.
