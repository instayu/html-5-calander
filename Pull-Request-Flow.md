Introduction
------------
Getting code into [source](https://github.com/yui/yui3) is a process that can lead to confusion, especially if it is your first time working with Git and Branch Driven Development. Here is a quick list of git and `yogi` commands that you may use in the life cycle of your pull request. Assume that you are creating some code that you want to go into the next release - which right now would be `3.x`. You **do not ever** check in directly to `3.x` or `master`. Instead you issue pull requests against `dev-3.x` or `dev-master`. The code below assumes `dev-3.x` for this example. `foo-123456` is the development branch that you will issue the pull request from. It has all your new and changed code (name it something meaningful).

Get [`yogi`](https://github.com/yui/yogi)
--------

`npm -g install yogi`

Set up GitHub
-------------

(See [How to Set Up your Git Environment](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/tutorials/git/) )

Bug Branch Creation
-------------------

```
git checkout dev-3.x
git pull upstream dev-3.x
git checkout -b foo-123456
```

Do code stuff. You should always be pushing to origin.
(see [Contribution Standards](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Contribution-Standards)) 

_If you have travis connected, this will show you build failures._

* Do tests. `yogi test`
* Do builds. `yogi build`
* Do commits as you go on all files **except builds**.  You will commit build files later in the process.
* Write documentation (depending on how big your changes are).
   * API Docs
   * Examples
   * User Guides
   * Code comments



Everyday
--------

```
git checkout dev-3.x
git pull upstream dev-3.x
git checkout foo-123456
git merge dev-3.x
```

Fix any merge issues to make sure your build is clean.

When you are ready for a Pull Request
-------------------------------------

```
git merge dev-3.x
git push origin foo-123456
```

Issue pull request through GitHub's ui against dev-3.x
-------------------------------------------

Be sure you have unit tests (see minimum requirements under [Contribution Standards](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Contribution-Standards)).

Be sure to switch to the 'dev-3.x' branch on the GitHub site when setting up the pull request.
 
When the pr is approved
-----------------------

( **You must be a commiter or reviewer in order to actually pull in code.** See the [Contributor Model](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Contributor-Model))

```
git checkout dev-3.x
git pull upstream dev-3.x
git merge foo-123456
```

Build and add commit build files.

Edit HISTORY.md (usually with something like @VERSION@ + your change information).

Push up to dev-3.x

`git push upstream dev-3.x`

Or, if you use a local dev-3.x branch:
```
git checkout dev-3.x
git pull upstream dev-3.x
git checkout foo-123456
git merge dev-3.x
git commit -m 'Merge in dev-3.x'
git checkout dev-3.x
git merge foo-123456
git commit -m 'Merge in fix for #123456 by [anonymous]'
git push upstream dev-3.x
```

Additional Info
---------------
View pull request info from `yogi`:
```
cd yui3/

//Show all open pull requests
yogi pulls 

//Show how you can merge this in.. (doesn't do anything but print, not dangerous)
yogi pulls 399 --show-merge
```

If your push clears CI, your changes will show up in the repo and the referenced pull request will automatically be closed.
